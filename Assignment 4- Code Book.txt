Coursera Course: Getting and Cleaning Data
Week 4: Course Project 

My RUN_ANALYSIS.R file analyzes data downloaded from: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To create an R script that does the following.

		1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
		2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
		3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
		4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
		5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 				   activity and each subject.

Then I assigned the data to variables

	feat <- features.txt	:: 	Features drawn fromm accelerometer and gyroscope data in 3 axis 

	activity, activity_labels, activity_num <- activity_labels.txt 	::	List of 6 activities performed by test subjects
	
	x_train <- X_train.txt	::	Contains raw data from volunteers performing various activities
	
	y_train <- y_train.txt	:: 	Labels for the training data

	sub_train <- subject_train.txt		:: Identifiers for subjects who performed the activities in the training data set

	x_test <- X_test.txt	:: Contains raw data from volunteers performing various activities

	y_test <- y_test.txt	:: Labels for the testing data 

	sub_test <- subject_test.txt	:: Identifiers for subjects who performed the activities in the testing data set

To merge the training and test data sets

	alltrain <- data table made from all the training data using cbind
	alltest <- data table made from all the testing data using cbind
	traintest <- complete data set from both the alltest and alltrain data using rbind

To extract measurements for Mean and Standard Deviation

	wantedfeat <- uses grep to select all column names that contain Mean and Standard Deviation

To label the data set with descriptive variable names 

	Using gsub to modify parts ( [] ) of the column headers to more descriptive words 
	
	[ f ] -> FrequencyDomain 
	[ t ] -> TimeDomain 
	[ Acc ] -> Acceleration
	[ Gyro ] -> Gyroscope
	[ Freq ] -> Frequency
	[ mean ] -> Mean 
	[ std ] -> StandardDeviation
	[ BodyBody ] -> Body


To label the data with descriptive variable names

	keepdata$Activity <- Changes the activity column from numbers to their corresponding activity

To create an independent tidy data set 
		
		finalmeans <- created by grouping and summarizing the finaldata set and writing it out to another file called FinalData.txt
